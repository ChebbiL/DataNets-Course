# DataNets-Course
This repository includes Lecture Notes and Lab Exercises in Python for a course named "Data Analysis (for Networks)" taught at Sorbonne University. 
The slides of the Lecture Notes and the Exercises in Python have been developed by me (Anastasios Giovanidis), and closely follow the book:
